            <li>Canned tomatoes - 1 can</li>
            <li>Tomato paste - 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Brown onion - 1</li>
            <li>Garlic - 4 cloves</li>
            <li>Red chilli - To your liking</li>
            <li>Olive oil - 1 tablespoon</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper - To your liking</li>
            <li>Basil - To your liking</li>
            <li>Vegan cheese - For topping</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dice onion and finely mince garlic. If using chilli, finely chop it now.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large fry pan on medium heat. Once hot, add onion.</li>
            <li>Once onion becomes soft and translucent, add garlic and chilli. Add in the tomato paste, and cook until the paste darkens and the garlic is fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add in the canned tomatoes, and reduce to low heat. Keep on low heat until the pasta is ready.</li>
            <li>After adding the tomatoes, bring a pot of salted water to the boil.</li>
            <li>Once boiled, add pasta and cook as per instructions.</li>
            <li>Once cooked, drain the pasta, reserving a small amount of pasta water (100mL).</li>
            <li>Add the pasta to the fry pan, with a little of the reserved pasta water.</li>
            <li>Mix well, and cook until the pasta water has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, topping with basil and vegan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
